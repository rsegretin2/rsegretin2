### Hello World 👋

I've been coding for a (long) while, from the back to the front and everything in-between. I've done pretty and ugly stuff, worked in big and small projects, horrible and beautiful languages and stacks. Always with coffee ☕ or mate 🧉.

Currently loving NodeJS over every other environment 💚 and teaching some of it at [ComIT](https://www.comunidadit.org/)

You can find me on<br>
